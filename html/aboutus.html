    <h1 style="text-align: center;">We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.</h1>
    <p>ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the
      Brisbane metropolitan area.<br> ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keepingfit and improving your
      health is not just a fad - it's a way of life.<br>
    Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy,<br> or just
      looking and feeling better - we're here for you! ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise
      options,<br>including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss, <br>circuit
      training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to
      none<br>&ndash; all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements.&nbsp;
    We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. <br>Our gym
      world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for
      themselves,<br>our members do our marketing.
    We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up. <br>You
      are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever.<br> With
      hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a
      refreshing<br>change from that.</p>
    <p>Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate. <br> We have created
      gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. <br>Our gyms
      have an old school feel with a new school<br>attitude!</p>
